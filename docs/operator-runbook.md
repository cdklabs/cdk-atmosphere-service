## üö® Alarms

### `Allocate/Errors`

Description

Fires when the `Allocate` Lambda function throws an error. Note that the function is
configured as an HTTP proxy to our `APIGateway` endpoint, this means that the function
returns a 500 status code in case of a failure, and should never throw.

The alarm indicates the lambda handler code did not run as expected, i.e the encoutered
error was not explicitly caught and converted to a 500 response.

Impact

Integration tests may start failing as they will not be able to acquire environments.

Investigation

Dive into the `CloudWatch` logs of the function to see the errors.

Resolution

The alarm will automatically go back to green once the Lambda function stops failing.

### `Allocate/Pool/${pool}/StatusCode/500`

Description

Fires when the `Allocate` Lambda function returns 500 errors. This alarm is
sectioned by the pool passed in the allocation request.

It means an exception was thrown (and caught) somewhere in the handler code.

Impact

Integration tests may start failing as they will not be able to acquire environments.

Investigation

Dive into the `CloudWatch` logs of the function to see the errors.

Resolution

The alarm will automatically go back to green once the Lambda function stops failing.

### `Allocate/Pool/UNKNOWN/StatusCode/500`

### `Cleanup/Pool/${pool}/ExitCode/1`

### `Cleanup/Pool/UNKNOWN/ExitCode/1`

### `Deallocate/Errors`

Description

Fires when the `Deallocate` Lambda function throws an error. Note that the function is
configured as an HTTP proxy to our `APIGateway` endpoint, this means that the function
returns a 500 status code in case of a failure, and should never throw.

The alarm indicates the lambda handler code did not run as expected, i.e the encoutered
error was not explicitly caught and converted to a 500 response.

Impact

Integration tests won't be able to release environments. This won't fail the test,
but may cause environment depletion that can lead to failures in subsequent tests.

Investigation

Dive into the `CloudWatch` logs of the function to see the errors.

Resolution

The alarm will automatically go back to green once the Lambda function stops failing.
